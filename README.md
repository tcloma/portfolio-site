### General Idea

-  Vertical Slideshow Layout
-  Responsive
-  Simplistic but animation heavy (esp scroll animations)

### To do:

-  Simplistic nav on the side representing each "slide" were on
   -  On hover shows the `href` title of that slide
   -  maybe add capability for keyboard only navigation
-  Each slide will have a different influence on the background
   -  Slides will mostly be projects
   -  Contains:
      -  Project title and tech stack used as chips
      -  Relevant links (eg. Deployed / Github)
      -  Projects demo
      -  Brief description
      -  Lessons / challenges
